# Chapel Hypergraph Library
The **C**hapel **H**yper**g**raph **L**ibrary (CHGL) is a library
for hypergraph computation in the emerging Chapel language.  Hypergraphs
generalize graphs, where a hypergraph edge can connect any number of vertices.
Thus, hypergraphs capture high-order, high-dimensional interactions between
multiple entities that are not directly expressible in graphs.  CHGL is designed
to provide HPC-class computation with high-level abstractions and modern
language support for parallel computing on shared memory and distributed memory
systems.
