CHGL-Server
===========
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use CHGL-Server;

.. data:: config const ServerPort = 5555

   
   This is a server intended to be used with a python client connected
   over ZMQ. This has been heavily inspired by Arkouda, the first project
   to take this approach. This is a prototype and is intended as a brief
   proof-of-concept; the hope is that CHGL will have integration with Arkouda
   at a later date.
